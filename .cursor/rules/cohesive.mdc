    Use UI patterns and interface solutions already present in existing pages.
    Do not implement new logic unless explicitly requested in the instructions.
    Write only the minimum necessary code to fulfill the requirements.
    Avoid creating abstractions unless they are clearly needed.
    Do not add new functionality to existing shared components (e.g., do not add row selection to a shared datagrid).
